# Build vs Buy Calculator

A simple calculator to compare the long-term cost of using a SaaS product versus building a custom solution.

This tool exists because many subscriptions feel cheap monthly but become expensive over time — while small, purpose-built tools are often more affordable than expected.

## What it does

The calculator compares:
- Ongoing SaaS subscription costs
- One-time custom build costs
- The break-even point between the two

It’s designed to support clearer decision-making, not to recommend one option over the other.

## What it does *not* do

- It does not account for opportunity cost
- It does not estimate maintenance or scaling complexity
- It does not recommend specific tools

This is intentional. The goal is clarity, not persuasion.

## Why this exists

This tool was built to remove friction encountered in real-world work:
when deciding whether to subscribe to yet another tool or build something simpler.

If the friction keeps showing up, it’s usually cheaper to solve it properly.

## How to use

1. Enter the monthly SaaS cost
2. Enter number of users
3. Estimate how long you’ll use the tool
4. Enter an estimated one-time build cost

The calculator updates instantly.

## Part of frictionless

This tool is part of the **frictionless** project — a collection of small, purpose-built tools created to remove everyday friction.
