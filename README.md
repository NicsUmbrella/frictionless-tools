# frictionless-tools
Tools built to remove everyday friction.

This repository contains small utilities, experiments, and purpose-built tools created to solve real problems encountered in daily work.

Some tools are shared as-is.
Some are early explorations.
All exist because something felt harder than it should have been.

Build what’s missing. Share what works.
